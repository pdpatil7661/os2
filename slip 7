Q.1	Consider the following snapshot of the system A B C D is the resource type

                      Process	           Allocation       Max	       Available
	                                     A	B C D	    A B C D    A B C D
                         P0	             2	0 0 1	    4 2	1 2    3 3 2 1
                         P1	             3	1 2 1	    5 2	5 2				
                         P2	             2	1 0 3	    2 3	1 6				
                         P3	             1	3 1 2	    1 4	2 4				
                         P4	             1	4 3 2       3 6	6 5				
using Resource â€“Request algorithm to Check whether the current system is in safe state or not
